# Acronym

Convert a phrase to its acronym.

Techies love their TLA (Three Letter Acronyms)!

Help generate some jargon by writing a program that converts a long name
like Portable Network Graphics to its acronym (PNG).

## Getting Started

Make sure you have read the [Installation](https://exercism.io/tracks/fortran/installation) and [Running the tests](https://exercism.io/tracks/fortran/tests) pages for Fortran on exercism.io.
This covers the basic information on setting up the development environment expected by the exercises.

## Passing the tests

Get the first test compiling, linking and passing by following the [three rules of test-driven development](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd).

The tests are in `acronym_test.f90` and they expect the implementation to be in `acronym.f90`.
In case the file `acronym.f90` does not exist, create the file with the content:

```c
module acronym
  implicit none
contains

  ! Create your function here

end module acronym
```

Now create a build directory (eg. `mkdir build`), change into it and run `cmake ..`  to configure the build.

Note, that the first time you call `cmake ..` it will download the `testlib` automatically which is used in `acronym_test.f90`.

The `testib` can also be downloaded manually from github. For more information see [Running the tests](https://exercism.io/tracks/fortran/tests).

Now build (eg. `make`)  and run tests with `ctest -V`. For a detailed description see [Running the Tests](https://exercism.io/tracks/fortran/tests).

At first all test will fail.
To disable a certain test, simply comment it out with '!', eg.

```c
  ! Test 16: non-letters with question
  ! call assert_equal("Sure.", hey(":) ?"), "non-letters with question")
```

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.
