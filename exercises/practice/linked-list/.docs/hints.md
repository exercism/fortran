Implement the `list_t` type and the following procedures:

- `new` returns an empty list.
- `push` inserts an element with the specified value at the back of the list.
- `pop` removes an element from the back of the list and returns the value of that element.
- `unshift` inserts an element with the specified value at the front of the list.
- `shift` removes an element from the front of the list and returns the value of that element.
- `length` returns the number of elements in the list.
- `delete` removes the first element with the specified value from the list.
- `destroy` empties a list.

Remember to release dynamically allocated memory when it is no longer needed.
