# Raindrops

Your task is to convert a number into a string that contains raindrop sounds corresponding to certain potential factors. A factor is a number that evenly divides into another number, leaving no remainder. The simplest way to test if a one number is a factor of another is to use the [modulo operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation).

The rules of `raindrops` are that if a given number:

- has 3 as a factor, add 'Pling' to the result.
- has 5 as a factor, add 'Plang' to the result.
- has 7 as a factor, add 'Plong' to the result.
- _does not_ have any of 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, the result should be the digits of the number.

## Examples

- 28 has 7 as a factor, but not 3 or 5, so the result would be "Plong".
- 30 has both 3 and 5 as factors, but not 7, so the result would be "PlingPlang".
- 34 is not factored by 3, 5, or 7, so the result would be "34".


## Source

A variation on FizzBuzz, a famous technical interview question that is intended to weed out potential candidates. That question is itself derived from Fizz Buzz, a popular children's game for teaching division. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz)

## Getting Started

Make sure you have read the [Installation](https://exercism.io/tracks/fortran/installation) and [Running the tests](https://exercism.io/tracks/fortran/tests) pages for Fortran on exercism.io.
This covers the basic information on setting up the development environment expected by the exercises.

## Passing the tests

Get the first test compiling, linking and passing by following the [three rules of test-driven development](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd).

The tests are in `raindrops_test.f90` and they expect the implementation to be in `raindrops.f90`.
In case the file `raindrops.f90` does not exist, create the file with the content:

```c
module raindrops
  implicit none
contains

  ! Create your function here

end module raindrops
```

Now create a build directory (eg. `mkdir build`), change into it and run `cmake ..`  to configure the build.

Note, that the first time you call `cmake ..` it will download the `testlib` automatically which is used in `raindrops_test.f90`.

The `testib` can also be downloaded manually from github. For more information see [Running the tests](https://exercism.io/tracks/fortran/tests).

Now build (eg. `make`)  and run tests with `ctest -V`. For a detailed description see [Running the Tests](https://exercism.io/tracks/fortran/tests).

At first all test will fail.
To disable a certain test, simply comment it out with '!', eg.

```c
  ! Test 16: non-letters with question
  ! call assert_equal("Sure.", hey(":) ?"), "non-letters with question")
```
