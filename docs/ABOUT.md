# About

Fortran is a general-purpose, compiled imperative programming language.
Developed in the 1950s, it is the oldest high-level programming language.
It is particularly useful for numeric computation and scientific computing.

Fortran is portable and can run on almost any platform.
As Fortran values stability and backwards compatibility, Fortran programs can run for decades.

Fortran has been optimized for decades to execute efficiently, which has resulted in consistently being rated as one of the highest performing languages for energy and time.
